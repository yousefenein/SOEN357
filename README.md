## Introduction
In today's rapidly aging society, the well-being of elderly individuals, both physically and mentally, has emerged as a pivotal concern. The World Health Organization reports a significant increase in life expectancy, yet the period known as healthspan—free from chronic illness or degenerative conditions—concludes much earlier. This discrepancy highlights the urgent need for innovative solutions to extend the quality and independence of life for the elderly.

## Understanding the Problem
The introduction of pervasive technologies offers a beacon of hope, with the potential to enhance self-reliance, social engagement, and confidence among older adults, thus bridging the gap between life expectancy and healthspan. However, a critical barrier to this is the limited acceptance and adoption of such technologies, attributed largely to their lack of elder-friendly design and usability.

Compounding this challenge is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has imposed unprecedented restrictions on social interactions, disproportionately affecting the elderly who are at heightened risk. Social distancing and isolation measures, while necessary, have severed traditional means of connection and support, amplifying feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
