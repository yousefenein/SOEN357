## Understanding the Problem
In today's rapidly aging society, the well-being of elderly individuals, both physically and mentally, has emerged as a pivotal concern. The World Health Organization reports a significant increase in life expectancy, yet the period known as healthspan—free from chronic illness or degenerative conditions—concludes much earlier. This discrepancy underscores the urgent need for innovative solutions to extend the quality and independence of life for the elderly.

The advent of pervasive technologies offers a beacon of hope, with the potential to enhance self-reliance, social engagement, and confidence among older adults, thus bridging the gap between life expectancy and healthspan. However, a critical barrier to this optimistic future is the limited acceptance and adoption of such technologies, attributed largely to their lack of elder-friendly design and usability.

Compounding this challenge is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has imposed unprecedented restrictions on social interactions, disproportionately affecting the elderly who are at heightened risk. Social distancing and isolation measures, while necessary, have severed traditional means of connection and support, amplifying feelings of loneliness and disconnection.

In this context, our project seeks to design an application tailored to the unique needs and circumstances of the elderly, focusing on enhancing their physical and mental well-being during these trying times. By addressing the technological and usability barriers, our goal is to create a solution that is not only accessible and user-friendly but also enriching and supportive of the elderly's desire for an active, connected, and healthy life.

Through comprehensive research and analysis, including understanding the diverse technological competencies, physical, and cognitive capabilities of our target user group, we aim to uncover the core functionalities and features that will make the most significant impact. Our approach is user-centric, guided by empathy and a deep understanding of the elderly's daily challenges and aspirations
