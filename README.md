# Wellness companion 

<a name="Introduction"></a>
## Introduction
In today's rapidly aging society, the well-being of elderly individuals, both physically and mentally, has emerged as a pivotal concern. The World Health Organization reports a significant increase in life expectancy, yet the period known as healthspan—free from chronic illness or degenerative conditions—concludes much earlier. This discrepancy highlights the urgent need for innovative solutions to extend the quality and independence of life for the elderly. <br/>

## Understanding the Problem
The introduction of pervasive technologies offers a beacon of hope, with the potential to enhance self-reliance, social engagement, and confidence among older adults, thus bridging the gap between life expectancy and healthspan. However, a critical barrier to this is the limited acceptance and adoption of such technologies, attributed largely to their lack of elder-friendly design and usability. <br/>

Compounding this challenge is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has imposed unprecedented restrictions on social interactions, disproportionately affecting the elderly who are at heightened risk. Social distancing and isolation measures, while necessary, have severed traditional means of connection and support, amplifying feelings of loneliness and disconnection.<br/>

<a name="Solution"></a>
## Our Solution 
Wellness Companion is here to cater to their specific needs, aiming to significantly enhance their physical and mental well-being amidst the adversities posed by current times. It is a commitment to overcoming technological and usability barriers that have historically impeded the elderly's access to digital solutions. By carefully selecting and prioritizing features such as Virtual Social Spaces, Health Monitoring & Reminders, Cognitive Games and Activities as well as nutritional guidance, Wellness Companion aspires to be more than just a user-friendly platform; it seeks to be a comprehensive ecosystem that enriches the lives of its users. Our goal is to empower the elderly to lead active, connected, and healthy lives, ensuring that the application is not only accessible but also deeply supportive of their desire for independence and engagement. Through this focused approach, "Wellness Companion" directly addresses the core problems and leverages informed design choices to craft a solution that truly resonates with the elderly community. <br/>

# Research 
Recognizing the unique challenges this demographic faces, our research focused on understanding the effectiveness of existing solutions in promoting physical health, mental well-being, and social connectivity. <br/>

**Market Analysis:** We examined various health and wellness apps, noting their successes and shortcomings. Our analysis revealed that while there is a plethora of health monitoring and social interaction apps available, there is no one stop hub for many elderly needs. This gap in the market emphasised the importance of developing an app that is not only easy to use but also encompasses a holistic approach to desinging for the elderly. <br/>

**User-Centric Design:** Insights from our research highlighted the need for a highly intuitive interface, with accessibility features such as larger text sizes, voice commands, and simple navigation being paramount. Additionally, the importance of engaging content that encourages regular use, such as interactive exercise sessions and cognitive games, was identified as a key factor in sustaining user interest and participation. <br/>

**Technological Barriers:** A recurring theme in our research was the elderly's varied level of technological adeptness. To address this, we prioritized the development of a user-friendly tutorial system within Wellness Companion, guiding users through the app's features in a clear and supportive manner. This approach aims to build confidence among users, fostering greater independence and engagement with the app. <br/>

**Competitive Advantage:** By analyzing competitors, as mentioned earlier most applications are somewwhat tailored to a speicific niche, thus we identified a distinct opportunity for Wellness Companion to stand out by offering a more integrated experience. Our app combines health monitoring, cognitive stimulation, and social features in one platform, creating a one stop hub that is currently lacking in the market. <br/>

# Surveys 

To gain a comprehensive understanding of our users, we conducted a survey with 37 different responses focusing on seniors' technology use, health management, and social needs. Distributed across various senior communities, our survey aimed to uncover insights that may not be completely obvious and to pinpoint existing pain points within current digital solutions. <br/>

From our survey, we found a strong desire among seniors to adopt technology that could provide benefits to their daily lives. A significant 78% were open to the idea of using an app to manage their health and wellness if it was user-friendly and addressed their specific needs. Interestingly, we discovered that while technology adoption rates are increasing among the elderly, 63% were particularly interested in apps that offered community engagement features, preferring this over individual-focused health tracking tools. <br/>

## Design
<h2>Typography</h2>
We used Montserrat as the main format of our app since it is very minimalistic and suitable for the elderly. There are different font sizes used over the app based on the purposes (headers, labels, etc.). In addition, for the logo of our app, we used the Modern Antiqua font since it looks very aesthetic.

<img width="200" alt="LogoTypography" src="https://yousefenein.github.io/WellnessCompanion/Assets/logo_typography.png">


<h2>Color Palette</h2>
We decided to go with 4 colors in our app which are light blue, orange, black, and white. The reason for this is because these colors are easy-to-read, calm, and simple which suits very well for the elderly.
